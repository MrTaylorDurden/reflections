How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You don't have to read through the full code, but only through the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

See history, understand why certain changes where done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Saving happens at a logical point in time.
understandable for others in combination with the commit message.
even small changes are worth saving, which is hard to decide for automatically
saving tools.
Developer can make sure, that saved code compiles.
Any editor
offline usage



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
