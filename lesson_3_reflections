When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborate work with others
Be safe against data loss on local machine


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes on remote can be in conflict with local changes and e.g. break the local build.
