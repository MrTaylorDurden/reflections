When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborate work with others
Be safe against data loss on local machine


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes on remote can be in conflict with local changes and e.g. break the local build.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: Sort of clone in githueb
clone: Local copy of remote reposity
branch: a distinct sequence of commits


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

merge master into local branch and then fast-forward your changes in the remote repository
Offline work when the remote branch is not accessable


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be harder: It is harder to see which changes where introduced by a certain PR, since master is continously chaging.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Collaborate work: When there are many different pepople working on the master, in case of conflict changes might be overwritten without notice.

Advantage of working in master: Faster, in particular when you are the only one working in a repo.
Advantage of working in a branch: Conflicts with latest master are resolved before merging.
