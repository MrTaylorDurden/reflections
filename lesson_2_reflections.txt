What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

use git add to add only the files that belong to a certain logic change
Other files, not belonging to this change, can be left unstaged.
use git diff --staged to see the complete change


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Experimental changes
First, incomplete steps of a bigger change (that could possible brake the project)
collaborate with yourself: Stop or continue on a certain feature


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Find the last comment commit with two branches


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The label of the other commit disappears.
All commits of the merged branch are on the other branch. Commits are shown ordered by time of creation.
Use git show to compare the changes introduced by one commit compared to its parent.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pro: Fast for obvious cases
Cons: There might be some cases, where the merge results in wrong results, which will not be detected.
