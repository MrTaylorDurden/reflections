What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

use git add to add only the files that belong to a certain logic change
Other files, not belonging to this change, can be left unstaged.
use git diff --staged to see the complete change


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Experimental changes
First, incomplete steps of a bigger change (prevent braking the project)
